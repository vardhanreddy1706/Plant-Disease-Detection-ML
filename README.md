# Plant-Disease-Detection-ML
 Plant Disease Detection is a machine learning-based project designed to identify plant diseases from leaf images using deep learning techniques. The model helps farmers and researchers quickly diagnose plant health issues, leading to better crop management and improved yields.
	•	Detects multiple types of plant diseases from images.
	•	Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification.
	•	User-friendly interface (if you have a frontend).
	•	Trained on publicly available datasets.
 Python
	•	TensorFlow / Keras
	•	OpenCV
	•	NumPy, Pandas
	•	Matplotlib / Seaborn
	•	Flask or Streamlit
